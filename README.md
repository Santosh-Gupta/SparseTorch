Sparse Pytorch Training Library 

Biggest hurdle: latency of reading/writing values to memory mapped files. 

To do:

Fastest way to retrieve/write hundreds of thousands of float32 arrays in an instance, and set them to Pytorch tensor. 

Investigate parallelization, during machine learning forward pass/backwards pass/weight update. 

Maximize use of CPU + GPU ram. Optimal pre-fetching and parallelization depending on training parameters. 

What is it.
